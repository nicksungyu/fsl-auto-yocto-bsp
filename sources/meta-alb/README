OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for NXP Auto Linux BSP platforms
=============================================================

First time setup
----------------

To install all prerequisites before starting any build, run:
$ ./scripts/host-prepare.sh

Creating Build Directories and Testing the Installation
-------------------------------------------------------

You can create a build directory in the BSP root with command:

$ . nxp-setup-alb.sh -m <machine>

where <machine> can be any of the following NXP targets:
s32g274ardb2, s32g274aevb, etc.

When this is done, run command:
$ bitbake <image-name>

where <image-name> is any of the images fsl-image-base, fsl-image-auto, or any
of the images that the setup script reports as being available for the selected
machine. This will completely build u-boot, kernel, modules, and a rootfs ready
to be deployed.

Look for a build result in
`build_<machine>/tmp/deploy/images/`.

The file `<image-name>.sdcard` is a disk image with all necessary partitions and contains
the bootloader, kernel and rootfs. You can just low-level copy the data on this file to the
SD card device using dd as on the following command example:

$ sudo dd if=<image-name>.sdcard of=/dev/sd<partition> bs=1M && sync

To deploy only the rootfs to the target partition, run:
$ sudo tar -xzf <image-name>.tar.gz -C <destination>
where <destination> is the destination partition (as mounted on the host).
