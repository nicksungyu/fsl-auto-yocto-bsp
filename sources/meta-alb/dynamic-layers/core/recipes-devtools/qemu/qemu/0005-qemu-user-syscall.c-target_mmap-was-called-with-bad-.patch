Subject: [PATCH 5/7] qemu-user: syscall.c/target_mmap was called with bad fd

While this is not a functional delta, it is defensive as
the mmap implementation should ignore fd. If it doesn't in the future
due to some bug during development, at least stdin is not messed with.
This should help to avoid obscure bugs and side effects.
